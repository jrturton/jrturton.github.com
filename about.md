## Me
I am an iOS developer at [MartianCraft](http://martiancraft.com). In my spare time I do some writing and editing for [raywenderlich.com](http://www.raywenderlich.com).

I was technical editor of [Core Data By Tutorials](http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/core-data-tutorials-ios-8-swift-edition?source=richardturton) (affiliate link) which you can also buy as part of the [Swift By Tutorials Bundle](http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/swift-tutorials-bundle?source=richardturton) (another affiliate link). I was also the tech editor of [iOS Animations By Tutorials](http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/ios-animations-by-tutorials?source=richardturton) (er, yet another affiliate link).

I like to answer questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com):

</a>

You can see some of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jrturton). 

If you're interested in employing me, take a look at my [Stack Overflow Careers profile](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jrturton), though I am currently very happy, so make it interesting.    

I like to talk rubbish on Twitter:

<a href="https://twitter.com/richturton" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="true" data-size="large" data-dnt="true">Follow @richturton</a>

<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>

## This blog

This blog is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). Feel free to submit corrections as pull requests to the [source repo](https://github.com/jrturton/jrturton.github.com). 

I used to use [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), which suited me very well for a while, until I decided that I wanted the following:

- The ability to post and edit from anywhere
- To understand how every component of the site works

I'm still not entirely there, but I was using only a tiny fraction of the power of Octopress, which was essentially a black box to me. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) on its own is a much smaller black box that I am more comfortable with, I know what every file in the source repo is for, and I can write and publish for the site using [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/) and [Working Copy](http://workingcopyapp.com/) when I am away from my Mac.
