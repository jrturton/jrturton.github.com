Here's another example of the (slightly) hidden flexibility of UIButton. Until recently, I was not aware that, in the various `setX:forState:` methods, you can actually use a bitmask to specify multiple control states. Hopefully I'm not the only person in the world that didn't realise this and this article will help someone else.

In the documentation for `UIControl`, control states are described thusly (emphasis mine):

>The state of a control; **a control can have more than one state at a time**. States are recognized differently depending on the control. For example, a UIButton instance may be configured (using the setImage:forState: method) to display one image when it is in its normal state and a different image when it is highlighted.

So why would you care about this? Say you were implementing an edit button or a selection button with text, a background image and an image. You want different text and images for the selected and unselected states (e.g. `Edit` and `Done`), but you also want to modify the images or background images when highlighting - if you're creating your own theme for the app then the default darkening or dimming might not be what you want. 

So you actually need four images - normal, highlighted, selected and selected + highlighted. 

This is achieved like so: 

{%codeblock lang:objc %}

[self.button setBackgroundImage:normal forState:UIControlStateNormal];
[self.button setBackgroundImage:highlighted forState:UIControlStateHighlighted];
[self.button setBackgroundImage:selected forState:UIControlStateSelected];
[self.button setBackgroundImage:selectedHighlighted forState:UIControlStateSelected | UIControlStateHighlighted];
{%endcodeblock%}

You can do a similar thing with `setImage:forState` and `setTitle:forState:` (you need to specifically set a title for `UIControlStateSelected | UIControlStateHighlighted`, because otherwise the title for `UIControlStateNormal` will be used. If you're using different title text attributes, you also need to specifically set them for the selected + highlighted state. 

Here's a spectacularly ugly demonstration of the four states of a button:
