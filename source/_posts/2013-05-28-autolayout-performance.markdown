I was going to write an analysis of Florian Kugler's post [about autolayout performance](http://floriankugler.com/blog/2013/4/21/auto-layout-performance-on-ios), re-running the analysis using more realistic constraints, but [a better man has beaten me to it](http://pilky.me/view/36). If you haven't seen these two posts already, I highly recommend them.
