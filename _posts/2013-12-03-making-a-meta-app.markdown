I've [written a post for the Mubaloo developer blog](http://mubaloo.com/news-info/making-a-metaapp-helper-mac-apps-for-ios-developers) about writing meta-apps. By meta app, I mean an app to help to support the *actual* app you're writing. 

For a recent prototype, which had a lot of functionality but no web services, I made one of these to populate and maintain the prototype data instead of cluttering the main app with lots of creation code. It was a revelation, and I'll be keeping this approach firmly in mind for future projects.
