Readers of this post will hopefully fall into one of two categories:

- "Well duh, this is obvious! Why are you writing about this?"
- "OH! That suddenly makes sense!"

_(Hopefully, nobody will fall into the third category, which is "I still don't understand!")_

If you're in the first category, congratulations, but you're not really the target audience.

Here's an exerpt of the documentation for `NSDate`'s `compare:` method:

>Returns an NSComparisonResult value that indicates the temporal ordering of the receiver and another given date.

>`- (NSComparisonResult)compare:(NSDate *)anotherDate`

>Returns:


>If the receiver and `anotherDate` are exactly equal to each other, `NSOrderedSame`

>If the receiver is later in time than `anotherDate`, `NSOrderedDescending`

>If the receiver is earlier in time than `anotherDate`, `NSOrderedAscending`.

`NSOrderedSame` is pretty straightforward, but I've had a mental block over `NSOrderedDescending` / `NSOrderedAscending` for years, up to the point of writing categories on `NSDate` to return booleans for `isEarlierThan:` and so forth. I could understand it, but never _remember_ it, or be able to read code featuring it without it being a little speed bump in my understanding. 

No longer! Here's how I remember it:

As you read the `compare:` method, imagine a bar placed over the text. If the value on the left is larger than the one on the right, the bar is at an angle, sloping downwards (**descending**) in the reading direction, so the method returns `NSOrderedDescending`, and _vice versa_. As I said at the start, it seems obvious, but it wasn't to me until I visualised it like this, and usually that means it might also help somebody else. If it did, you're welcome.
